Titanic Dataset Analysis
Welcome to my project for analyzing the Titanic dataset. In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. It includes information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic and features such as age, sex, fare, and class.

## Tools and Libraries Used
1. Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and visualization.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
3. NumPy: For numerical operations.
4. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# During the EDA process, the following steps were performed:

## Data Cleaning:

Addressed missing values and filled or imputed them as appropriate.
Converted data types to correct formats.
Handled duplicates and inconsistencies.
## Visualization:

Created various plots to visualize the distribution of key variables:
Count Plots: Showed the distribution of survivors by gender and class.
Bar Charts and Histograms: Illustrated the distribution of numerical features like age and fare.
Correlation Heatmaps: Analyzed relationships between numerical features.
## Insights:

Explored survival rates across different classes and genders.
Identified patterns in age and fare distribution.
Investigated the impact of passenger features on survival probability.
# Conclusion
The EDA process provided insights into the distribution and relationships of variables in the Titanic dataset. These findings help in understanding key factors influencing survival and lay the groundwork for more advanced modeling and analysis.

Thank you for reviewing my project!
